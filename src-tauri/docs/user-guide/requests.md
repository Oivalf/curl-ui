# Building Requests

The Request Editor is the heart of Curl UI. It allows you to craft complex HTTP requests with ease.

## Request Basics

- **Method**: Select from standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
- **URL**: Enter the target endpoint. You can use variables like `{{baseUrl}}/users`.
- **Send**: Click the prominent **Send** button to execute the request.

## Editor Tabs

The editor is divided into several tabs to manage different aspects of the request:

### 1. Headers
Manage your HTTP headers. 
- **Inherited Headers**: Headers can be inherited from parent folders. These are shown as read-only items with a link to the source folder.
- **Local Headers**: Add headers specific to this request.

### 2. Body
Configure the request payload. Currently supports:
- **JSON**: A full-featured code editor for JSON payloads.
- **Text**: For plain text bodies.
- **None**: For requests without a body (like GET).

### 3. Pre-scripts & Post-scripts
Automate logic before and after the request.
- **Pre-scripts**: Execute JavaScript before the request is sent.
- **Post-scripts**: Execute logic after a response is received, with optional status code filtering (e.g., only run on `200`).

## The Response Panel

Once a request is sent, the response panel appears at the bottom:
- **Status & Time**: View the HTTP status code, response time, and payload size.
- **Body**: The formatted response payload.
- **Headers**: Full list of response headers.
- **Console**: View logs generated by your scripts via `console.log()`.
