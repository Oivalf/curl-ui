# 📦 Collections & Folders

cURL-UI uses a hierarchical structure to organize requests.

## Collections
A **Collection** is the top-level container, stored as a JSON file on disk.
- **Creation**: Create new collections or import existing JSON files or **Swagger/OpenAPI** specifications using the sidebar.
- **Saving**: Changes are not auto-saved. Use **File > Save** to persist modifications.

## Folders
Folders group related requests and support variable inheritance.
- **Settings**: Use the Folder Editor to manage local variables, authentication, and headers.
- **Inheritance**: Variables and settings defined in a folder apply to all its contents.

## Sidebar
- **Navigation**: Click items to open their respective editors.
- **Organization**: Use chevrons to expand or collapse folders and requests.
- **Context Menu**: Right-click items to add, duplicate, or delete requests and folders.
